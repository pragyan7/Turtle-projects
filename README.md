## Projects

### 1. Turtle Art
A creative project that demonstrates the capabilities of the turtle module to create artistic patterns and designs.

### 2. Turtle Race
A fun racing game where multiple turtles race across the screen to a finish line. Players can bet on which turtle will win.

A classic snake game where the player controls a snake to collect food. The snake grows longer with each food item collected, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen borders.
